				Corporate Resolution of the<br />
				Mainlands Seven Maintenance Corporation, Inc.
			</h1>
		</div>

		<!-- PREFACE -->
		<div>
			<p>
				WHEREAS, Mainland Seven Maintenance Corporation Inc. (hereafter referred to as "Association") is the corporate entity charged with the maintenance, management and operation of The Mainlands of Tamarac Lakes Seventh Section; and
			</p>
			<p>
				WHEREAS, the Board of Directors (hereafter referred to as "Board") is responsible for the day to day operation of the community and the Association; and
			</p>
			<p>
				WHEREAS, the Bylaws of the Association provide that the Officers of the Association (President, Vice President, Secretary and Assistant Secretary and the Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer) have specific assignments outlined in the Bylaws, the Directors-at-large have no specific written responsibility other than serving on the board; and
			</p>
			<p>
				WHEREAS, the Board of Directors believe that each director as opposed to officer should be asked to perform specific duties to aid the Board, therefore it is necessary to outline certain responsibilities for each of the five directors-at-large to share the load of responsibilities of the Board, and moreover so that each director-at-large will have a structured function on the Association Board of Directors.
			</p>
			<p>
				NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby resolved as follows:
			</p>
		</div>

		<!-- RESOLUTION -->
		<div class="section">
			<p>
				Each director on the board must have a specific duty and must be willing to learn the duties of that office, including the operation and mechanics of operation, with the aim of becoming fluent and able to handle individually his or her responsibilities, and also manage and monitor any vendors work. The director will select a committee from the membership to work with him. A committee member may ultimately learn to perform the duties of the Committee Chairman and become the future director. The director will report the status and progress of his committee at each board and general meeting.
			</p>
			<p>
				All work on each job assignment will become the sole responsibility of the director. All work should be done with his or her knowledge in order to centralize control.
