			<div class="section">
				<h1>4. Voting Methods</h1>

				<!-- ARTICLE 1, SECTION 4, PARAGRAPH A -->
				<div class="paragraph">
					<h1>A. Viva Voce</h1>

					<p>
						At all Membership meetings, all questions wherein the voting is not regulated by the ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION, elsewhere in these Bylaws, or by applicable law, will be determined by a voice vote of a majority of the members present in person or by proxy, with voting limited to one vote for each home owned. However, any qualified voter may demand a vote by written ballot. In such an instance, because of the potentially disruptive nature in the timeliness for a vote concerning an issue, the Chair will put a vote to the Floor, requesting a majority vote of the membership present for a written ballot. If the membership agrees that such a written ballot shall take place and a written ballot can be accomplished at the meeting in progress, the meeting will be suspended while the written ballot is prepared. If such a written ballot cannot be organized at the meeting, then the written ballot will be conducted at the next general meeting or at a Special Meeting where timeliness is a factor, such as with the Annual Budget. A written ballot may also be demanded by any qualified voter <b>in writing</b> 15 days prior to the date when the vote is scheduled to take place. Before the written ballot is executed, the Chair will announce to the membership for the record the fact that such a request has taken place and the name of the voter who requested the written ballot. In such case, to assure proper identification, each eligible voter will be required to sign the roll prior to receiving a ballot and each proxy holder shall sign the roll for the member for which the proxy is held. When, because of the importance of the question to be voted upon, it is desirable that as many home owners as possible have the opportunity to vote, the question may be postponed as a Special Order, to the next regular meeting; or to a Special Meeting called for that purpose.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- ARTICLE 1, SECTION 4, PARAGRAPH B -->
				<div class="paragraph">
					<h1>B. Absentee Ballots</h1>

					<p>
						Upon signed request submitted to the Secretary, an eligible voter unable to attend the meeting, may obtain an absentee ballot to vote in the election of directors and officers. The ballot provided will state the date of the election and the names of the candidates that have been nominated by the nominating committee, it will have spaces for checking the voter's preference as well as blank spaces for write-in candidates. Any absentee ballots containing votes in favor of candidates that have not signed the "willing to serve, if elected" form (at or prior to the election), will be discounted and the remainder of the ballot counted. Any absentee ballots containing votes for a number of candidates in excess of the number of vacant positions shall be rejected.
					</p>
					<p>
						The eligible voter will sign the paper indicating lot and block number and must return it to the Secretary along with his sealed ballot.

					<h1>B. Liability for Assessments</h1>

					<p>
						A Lot Owner, regardless of how title has been acquired, including by purchase at a foreclosure or sheriff's sale or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, is liable for all Assessments which come due while being the Lot Owner. Additionally, unless prohibited by the Declaration or Chapter 720, Florida Statutes, a Lot Owner is jointly and severally liable with the previous owner for all unpaid Assessments that came due up to the time of transfer of title. This liability is without prejudice to any right the Owner may have to recover from the previous owner the amounts paid by the Owner. The liability for Assessments may not be avoided by waiver of the use or enjoyment of any Association property or by abandonment of the Lot for which the Assessments are made.

In addition to the above stated interest, the Association shall charge an administrative late fee in the amount of twenty five ($25.00) dollars, or the highest amount permitted by law, for each delinquent installment or Assessment that the payment is late. The Board of Directors may waive interest or late charges on a case by case basis. Any payment received by the Association shall be applied first to any interest accrued by the Association, then to any administrative late fee, then to any costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in collection, and then to the Assessment. The foregoing method of applying payments shall be applicable notwithstanding any restrictive endorsement, designation, or instruction placed on or accompanying a payment.

						The Association has a lien on each Lot to secure the payment of Assessments or installments thereon, together with interest, late fees, costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the Association which are incident to the collection of the Assessment or enforcement of the lien, whether suit be brought or not. The claim of lien shall secure all unpaid Assessments which are due and which may accrue subsequent to the recording of the claim of lien and prior to the entry of a certificate of title, as well as interest, late fees, costs and attorney's fees incurred by the Association incident to the collection process, whether suit be brought or not. The Association may bring an action in its name to foreclose a lien for Assessments in the manner a mortgage of real property is foreclosed and may also bring an action to recover a money judgment for the unpaid Assessments without waiving any claim of lien. The Association is entitled to recover its reasonable attorney's fees incurred in either a lien foreclosure action or an action to recover a money judgment for unpaid Assessments. If the Lot Owner remains in possession of the Lot after a foreclosure judgment has been entered, the Lot Owner shall be required to pay to the Association a reasonable rental for the Lot. If the Lot is rented or leased during the pendency of the foreclosure action, the Association shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver to collect the rent, the expenses of the receiver to be paid for by the party which does not prevail in the foreclosure action. The Association, acting through its Board of Directors, shall have the right to assign its claim and lien rights for the recovery of any unpaid assessments to any third party.

In the event the amount of such installments changes during the period for which Assessments were accelerated, the Lot Owner or the Association, as appropriate, shall be obligated to pay or reimburse to the other the amount of increase or decrease within ten (10) days of same taking effect.

				<!-- ARTICLE 2, SECTION 5, PARAGRAPH F -->
				<div class="paragraph">
					<h1>F. Lien For Charges</h1>

						There is hereby created a common law and contractual lien to secure any service which the Association provides for a Lot or Lot Owner and which is not otherwise secured by the lien for assessments.

The lien for Charges shall be of equal priority to, shall be secured as to interest, late fees and attorney's fees and the like, and shall be foreclosed in the same manner as the lien for assessments.
