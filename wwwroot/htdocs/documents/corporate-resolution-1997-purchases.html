					All items or services which are not budgeted, and which the cost exceeds $10,000.00 cannot be undertaken without the approval of the voting members at a general or special meeting called for that purpose as provided for in Article 2, Section 6 of the By-Laws. A purchase and/or payment for said item or service may not be segmented in such a way that the $10,000.00 limit is circumvented. Items by or from the same vendor or contractor must be distinctly different or a distinctly different function or purpose to qualify as not being segmented to avoid the $10,000.00 limit.
