			<p>
				These Proposed Amended and Restated Bylaws; Proposed Rules and Regulations; and Corporated Resolutions are being proposed to update our current Bylaws and especially to add needed enforcement content throught stated Rules and Regulations in the Bylaws. In tum these Bylaws will be recorded in the Public Records of Broward County, Florida as required by law. Corporate Resolutions have also been added which provide structure and operating guidance for use of the Board of Directors.
			</p>
			<p>
				These Bylaws apply to <i>Mainlands 7 Maintenance Corporation, Incorporated</i>, a not-for profit <i>"Mandatory Homeowners Association"</i>, incorporated in the State of Florida, March 30, 1971.
			</p>
			<p>
				The enforcement of rules, regulations and restrictions contained in these Bylaws also apply to the <i>Mainlands of Tamarac Section Seven, Incorporated</i>, incorporated May 23, 1972, and owned by <i>Mainlands 7 Maintenance Corporation</i> above. Both of the above corporations are subdivisions of the following subdivision and coexist as a part of <i>The Mainlands of Tamarac Lakes Seventh Section</i>, according to the plat thereof recorded in <b>Plat Book 68, page 4, Public Records of Broward County, Florida</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				A recent opinion, May 28, 1997, by Lisa A. Woliner our attorney with Becker and Poliakoff states the ownership relationship above and a need to restate <i>Mainlands 7 Maintenance Corporation</i> rules and regulations in our Bylaws, as well as those Bylaws, which are appropriate in <i>The Mainlands of Tamarac Section Seven Constitution (Bylaws)</i>, in their respective Bylaws.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next two paragraphs are from a written opinion by Goodrich and Goodrich attorneys-at-law, provided to the <i>Board</i> July 5, 1973.
			</p>
			<p>
				"<i>Mainlands 7 Maintenance Corporation, Inc.</i> not only has the <i>authority</i> to deal with maintenance of the facilities, improvements to the property, and rules and regulations relating thereto, but more importantly has the <i>responsibility</i> to do so."
			</p>
			<p>
				"<i>Mainlands of Tamarac Section Seven, Inc.</i> is organized for the purpose of promoting the use of the recreation area and promoting social affairs. The <i>Articles of Incorporation</i> and its <i>Constitution makes no specific reference to ownership of property</i> by that organization, but clearly states that <i>Mainlands 7 Maintenance Corp., Incorporated</i> owns <i>Mainlands of Tamarac Section Seven, Incorporated</i>."
			</p>
			<p>
				The above should not be construed to mean, that one corporation dominates and dictates to the other, but that for all legal purposes, the above are the facts. Both corporations are co-shareholders and one must act in the interest of the other, to coexist jointly to enjoy the maximum benefit of both organizations.
