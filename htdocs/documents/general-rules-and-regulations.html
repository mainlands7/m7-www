			<h1>Recreation Area Rules and Regulations</h1>

			<!-- ARTICLE 3, SECTION 1 -->
			<div class="section">
				<h1>1. Recreation Corporation's Function</h1>

				<p>
					Recreation Board events are designed as a means to bring the community together, not solely to generate funds. Activities should be such that all ages as much as possible will be served with an interest. All funds generated must be used to promote further social functions and may be used for the purchase of items that will enhance the pleasure of the membership and the utility of the common grounds.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!-- ARTICLE 3, SECTION 2 -->
			<div class="section">
				<h1>2. No Smoking</h1>

				<p>
					Smoking is not permitted within the confines of the clubhouse. This includes restrooms and is meant to include all areas within the perimeter of the building walls.
				</p>
				<p>
					Violators may lose clubhouse rights by ignoring this rule and may be subject to fines. Fines levied pursuant to this paragraph may be in an amount of up to One Hundred ($100.00) Dollars per day of the continuing violation, up to a maximum amount of One Thousand ($1,000.00) Dollars as permitted by Florida Law.
				</p>
				<p>
					Smokers outside the clubhouse area are required to dispose of butts in the proper receptacle provided.

			<div class="section">
				<h1>3. Use of Common Areas and Facilities</h1>

				<p>
					Owned by corporation. As members you are asked to respect the rights of all co-owners and adhere to and obey the Rules and Regulations of the community.
				</p>
				<p>
					By virtue of being a property owner you have no authority to enforce the Rules and Regulations. Only authorized persons may carry out the enforcement procedures. The Vice President or a member of the Board designated as the Code Enforcement Officer does have such authority within the limits of the law.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is expected that all homeowners use tact and tolerance if a violation is witnessed, or a violation occurs. Do not use abusive and embarrassing language to the violator, but if you are so inclined remind the violator tactfully of the violation. If the violation is repeated report the violation to the Code Enforcement Officer for proper action.
				</p>
				<p>
					The recreation area is the focal point of community activity. This is where cooperation and trust between residents is borne. Animosity, hate and lack of respect for human rights can also develop and polarize and ruin community spirit, if handled improperly.
				</p>
				<p>
					After using the facilities it is expected that you will leave the area or equipment in the same or better condition, when you have finished with your activity. Janitorial and cleaning services are performed once a week. Your cooperation will be appreciated by all.
