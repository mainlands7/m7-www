				(Last Revised 03/07/2002)
			</h2>

		<!-- ARTICLE 1 -->

			<p>
				All Association Rules and Regulations must be enforced uniformly. What is good for one homeowner, must be good for or against another. Failure of the Association to enforce a rule or to enforce it only against certain individuals but not others is prohibited.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a resident of Mainland of Tamarac Lakes Section Seven, you are also a resident of The City of Tamarac, Florida, and subject to that City's Municipal Code. No action by the city, such as the issuing of a permit, implies permission by the City to violate any deed restriction. Where a local deed restriction coincides with a properly enacted provision of the Municipal Code, the City itself has the right to enforce that deed restriction.

					A homeowner whose roof is tiled, may elect to enter a program providing roof cleaning and painting. (This program does not include roof repair or tile replacement.)

				<i>The Recreational Parcel (Area) consists of the pool area, the clubhouse and the clubhouse grounds and facilities.</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Our Declaration of Restrictions states that the Declarant (Behring Properties) had not only the right, but the obligation to operate the recreational facilities as owner of the Recreational Parcel. Part of the operation of the facilities is the promulgation and enforcement of regulations governing the permitted uses of the property. Our amended Bylaws are based upon this Declaration of Restrictions and have been registered with the Public Records of Broward County as of April 4, 1998 (BK28011PG0710-0727). In Article II, Section 11, our Bylaws provide the Association with the absolute right, as exercised exclusively by the Board of Directors, to monitor and regulate the use of the Recreational Parcel.</i>

				<h1>3. Use of Common Area and Facilities.</h1>

				<p>
					No person shall be permitted to run, play, shout, or behave in any manner dangerous or annoying to others in the clubhouse.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Common Area and its Facilities are owned by the Corporation. All owners are requested to respect the rights of all co-owners and to adhere to and obey the Rules and Regulations of the community.
				</p>
				<p>
					A property owner has no authority enforce the Rules and Regulations. Only authorized persons may carry out the enforcement procedures. The Vice President, however, or a member of the Board designated as the Code Enforcement Officer has such authority within the limits of the law.
				</p>
				<p>
					The recreational area is the focal point of community activity. This is where cooperation and trust between residents is born. Animosity, hate and lack of respect for human rights can also develop and polarize and ruin community spirit, if handled improperly.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is expected that all homeowners use tact and tolerance if a violation is witnessed, or when a violation occurs. A tactful reminder to the violator is more desirable, civil and neighborly rather than abusive or embarrassing language. If the violation is repeated it should be reported to the Code Enforcement Officer for proper action.
				</p>
				<p>
					After using the facilities it is expected that each homeowner or guest will leave the area or equipment in the same or better condition as it was found, replacing lounge chairs from where they were taken, leaving trash and litter in the containers provided, cleaning picnic table surfaces and areas after use, etc., when finished with an activity. Janitorial and cleaning services are performed once a week by homeowner volunteers and paid contractors. Your cooperation will be appreciated by all.
