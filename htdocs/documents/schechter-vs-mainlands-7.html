				</li>
				<li>
					The Defendant, MAINLANDS SEVEN MAINTENANCE CORP., INC., is a Florida corporation not for profit whose membership consists solely and exclusively of the owner of all of the residential lots in the Mainlands of Tamarac Lakes Seventh Section in Broward County, Florida.

					<p style="margin-left: 3em;">
						PARCEL R of the MAINLANDS OF TAMARAC LAKES SEVENTH SECTION, according to the Plat thereof recorded in Plat Book 68, Page 4 of the Public Records of Broward County, Florida, together with the personal property therein and thereon and fixtures therein and thereon and the lease recorded in O.R. Book 3961, Page 911 of the Public Records of Broward County, Florida.
					</p>
					<p>
						The warranty deed reflecting said purchase is dated April 7, 1978, and was recorded on April 7, 1978, in Official Records book 7505, Page 162 of the Public Records of Broward County, Florida.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					The purchase of the aforesaid real property and interest therein by the homeowners not for profit corporation is beneficial to the homeowners and will enhance the value of their homes.
				</li>
				<li>
					The aforesaid purchase constitutes a substantial and material change of circumstances regarding paragraph 7 (recreation rent) of the Declaration of Restrictions burdening the residential lots in Mainlands of Tamarac Lakes Seventh Section.
				</li>
				<li>
					Petitioner is desirous of modifying the aforesaid paragraphs of the Declaration of Restrictions in order to reflect the purchase, to modify the amounts required to be paid by homeowners under paragraph 7, and to provide a method of terminating the recreation lease in said subdivision.

					For the sake of the owners of residential lot owners in said subdivision and their successors and assigns, it is essential that the public record reflect the actual and current ownership of the Parcel R and the relationship of the lot owners to that Parcel R. Said ownership and relationship constitutes sufficiently changed circumstances to invoke this Court's equitable powers to modify said Declaration of Restrictions.
