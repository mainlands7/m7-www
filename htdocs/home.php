	The Mainlands of Tamarac Lakes Seventh Section ("Mainlands 7") is a community of 225 single-family homes located just northwest of the intersection of Commercial Boulevard and Florida's Turnpike in Tamarac, Florida (<a onclick="javascript: window.open(this.href); return false;" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=4914+NW+57TH+ST+TAMARAC+FL+33319-2846&amp;sll=37.794448,-122.394887&amp;sspn=0.012378,0.028539&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=26.195137,-80.216053&amp;spn=0.007028,0.014269&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;om=1">map</a>).  The community was originally developed in 1969 to be a destination for retirees from the Northeast but is now open to residents of all ages.  Most of the neighborhood is sequestered from through traffic, and as such, Mainlands 7 displays an unusually quiet and relaxed atmosphere in the middle of South Florida's dense metropolitan sprawl.
